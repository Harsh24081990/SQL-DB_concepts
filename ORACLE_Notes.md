- Oracle db can be accessed using '**Sql Developer**' or '**Toad for Oracle**'.
- **Oracle Client** needs to be installed if using Toad and want to see all the available db server names in a drop down list in toad.
- sql developer uses it's inbuilt **JDBC driver**, so it can be used without oracle client installation if we know the following details and don't need db list auto fetched in a dropdown.
    - Hostname / IP
    - Port (default 1521)
    - Service Name (or SID)
- If need to see the server (db names) auto fetched in the dropdown list then need to use **"`tnsnames.ora`"** **file** along with **oracle client**.
-------------------
- Oracle internally stors **decimal** as **number**
- DECIMAL(p,s) → ANSI SQL synonym for NUMBER(p,s).
- Both mean the same thing.
-----------
#### Case sensitivity in oracle:-
* By default:
- Table names and column names are not case-sensitive.
- Oracle automatically stores them in uppercase in the data dictionary.
- If you create columns/tables with double quotes, Oracle preserves the case and makes it case-sensitive.
- Ex. ```CREATE TABLE "Emp" ("Emp_Id" NUMBER, "Emp_Name" VARCHAR2(50));```

## in oracle (PL/SQL) explain the meaning of below keyworkds/syntaxes:-
1. whenever oserror exit sql.sqlcode;
2. whenever sqlerror exit sql.sqlcode;
3. set serveroutput on size unlimited
4. set verify on
5. set sqlblanklines on
6. set timing on 
7. DEFINE dop = 8; and used in "INSERT /*+ parallel($dop) * / INTO .... "
8. DECLARE V_POS VARCHAR2(10) :=0;
V_POS :=1 (in Begin block before insert into statement. and V_POS :=2 at the end of insert into statement)
9. DBMS.OUPUT.PUT_LINE (' no of rows ' || sql%rowcount); what is meant by sql% here ?
10. EXECUTE dbms_output.enable(2000000);
11. prompt End of process: - what is meant by prompt , is it different than dbms.output.put_line ?
12. AFTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML
13. SPOOL
------------

Here’s a short explanation for each:

---

**1. `whenever oserror exit sql.sqlcode;`**

* In SQL*Plus, tells the script to **exit if an OS error occurs** (like file access issue).
* `sql.sqlcode` → exit with the Oracle SQL error code.

---

**2. `whenever sqlerror exit sql.sqlcode;`**

* In SQL*Plus, tells the script to **exit when an Oracle SQL error occurs**.
* Example: if a query fails with ORA-00942, the script stops.

---

**3. `set serveroutput on size unlimited`**

* Enables output from `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE` to be displayed in SQL*Plus/Toad.
* `size unlimited` → no limit on buffer size for output.

---

**4. `set verify on`**

* Controls whether SQL*Plus shows the **old and new values of substitution variables** when you run a query.
* Useful for debugging scripts with `&variable`.

---

**5. `set sqlblanklines on`**

* Allows blank lines within SQL statements in SQL*Plus.
* Without it, blank lines terminate the statement.

---

**6. `set timing on`**

* Displays the **time taken** for each SQL/PLSQL command after execution.

---

**7. `DEFINE dop = 8;` and `INSERT /*+ parallel(&dop) */`**

* `DEFINE` creates a SQL*Plus substitution variable.
* `dop` (degree of parallelism) = 8 here.
* In the hint, `parallel(&dop)` gets replaced with `parallel(8)` → runs insert in parallel with 8 threads.

---

**8. `DECLARE V_POS VARCHAR2(10) :=0;` and later `V_POS :=1;`, `V_POS :=2;`**

* Declares a PL/SQL variable `V_POS`.
* Assigned values (`0,1,2`) at different points in the block → often used as a **debug marker** (to know where an error occurred).

---

**9. `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(' no of rows ' || SQL%ROWCOUNT);`**

* `SQL%` refers to **implicit cursor attributes** in PL/SQL.
* `SQL%ROWCOUNT` = number of rows affected by the most recent DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
* Other attributes: `SQL%FOUND`, `SQL%NOTFOUND`, `SQL%ISOPEN`.

---

**11. `prompt End of process:`**

* `PROMPT` is a SQL*Plus command to print text to screen.
* Unlike `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`, it does **not require serveroutput on** and is **not PL/SQL**.
* Used for user messages in scripts.

---
If your .sql file sits on a Unix server and is scheduled via Control-M, here’s what happens:
- Control-M will call an Oracle client (command-line) to run the script.
- That client is almost always sqlplus (sometimes sqlcl, but rarely in legacy projects).
- SQL Developer is a GUI IDE, not designed to be run in batch/scheduled mode.
- Whatever sqlplus prints (results, DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE, PROMPT, row counts, ORA- errors, etc.) → goes to the job log generated by Control-M. You can view this in Control-M GUI (Job Output / Log tab).

-------------
**10. `EXECUTE dbms_output.enable(2000000);`**

- The number 2000000 specifies the maximum buffer size in bytes (here, 2 MB).

- Without this, any PUT_LINE output won’t be shown in tools like SQL Developer or SQL*Plus.

- In short: it turns on the message/output display for PL/SQL code execution and sets the limit for how much text can be stored and displayed.

----

**12. `AFTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML;`**

The statement

```sql
ALTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML;
```

in an Oracle script does the following:

* It enables **parallel DML (Data Manipulation Language)** operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) in the current session.
* Without this session-setting, even if you specify a parallel hint (e.g., `/*+ PARALLEL(table,8) */`) or a table is defined with a parallel degree, the **actual DML changes** will execute serially (not using parallel execution) unless the session is enabled for parallel DML.
* Once enabled, any eligible DML statement in that session *can* execute in parallel (subject to other conditions) if it meets the prerequisites (such as table being parallel enabled, partitioned, etc.)

**Key things to note / prerequisites:**

* Enabling the session just marks that DML *may* run in parallel; it doesn’t guarantee it — many restrictions apply. 
* After enabling, you typically still supply a parallel hint or have objects defined to allow parallelism. Example:

  ````sql
  ALTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DML;
  INSERT /*+ PARALLEL(my_table,8) */ INTO my_table SELECT … ;

* If you skip the `ALTER SESSION` and only specify the hint, you may see parallelism in the *query portion* but the *DML write* portion will execute serially.

----

**13. `SPOOL`**

- In Oracle (and general computing), SPOOL means to write output to a file instead of displaying it on screen.
- The term comes from "Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line", originally referring to temporarily storing data meant for devices like printers.
- If using SPOOL, verything displayed on screen — like query results, DBMS_OUTPUT text, or error messages — is spooled (logged) into that file.
- It keeps recording until you issue: **`SPOOL OFF`**

----------

**14. `@scriptname.sql`**
- Execute the SQL script file named scriptname.sql.
- The file can contain any valid SQL or PL/SQL statements (e.g., CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, etc.).
- SQL*Plus reads and runs each command in that file sequentially.
