- Oracle db can be accessed using '**Sql Developer**' or '**Toad for Oracle**'.
- **Oracle Client** needs to be installed if using Toad and want to see all the available db server names in a drop down list in toad.
- sql developer uses it's inbuilt **JDBC driver**, so it can be used without oracle client installation if we know the following details and don't need db list auto fetched in a dropdown.
    - Hostname / IP
    - Port (default 1521)
    - Service Name (or SID)
- If need to see the server (db names) auto fetched in the dropdown list then need to use **"`tnsnames.ora`"** **file** along with **oracle client**.
-------------------
- Oracle internally stors **decimal** as **number**
- DECIMAL(p,s) → ANSI SQL synonym for NUMBER(p,s).
- Both mean the same thing.
-----------
#### Case sensitivity in oracle:-
* By default:
- Table names and column names are not case-sensitive.
- Oracle automatically stores them in uppercase in the data dictionary.
- If you create columns/tables with double quotes, Oracle preserves the case and makes it case-sensitive.
- Ex. ```CREATE TABLE "Emp" ("Emp_Id" NUMBER, "Emp_Name" VARCHAR2(50));```

## in oracle (PL/SQL) explain the meaning of below keyworkds/syntaxes:-
1. whenever oserror exit sql.sqlcode;
2. whenever sqlerror exit sql.sqlcode;
3. set serveroutput on size unlimited
4. set verify on
5. set sqlblanklines on
6. set timing on 
7. DEFINE dop = 8; and used in "INSERT /*+ parallel($dop) * / INTO .... "
8. DECLARE V_POS VARCHAR2(10) :=0;
V_POS :=1 (in Begin block before insert into statement. and V_POS :=2 at the end of insert into statement)
9. DBMS.OUPUT.PUT_LINE (' no of rows ' || sql%rowcount); what is meant by sql% here ?
10. prompt End of process: - what is meant by prompt , is it different than dbms.output.put_line ?
------------

Here’s a short explanation for each:

---

**1. `whenever oserror exit sql.sqlcode;`**

* In SQL*Plus, tells the script to **exit if an OS error occurs** (like file access issue).
* `sql.sqlcode` → exit with the Oracle SQL error code.

---

**2. `whenever sqlerror exit sql.sqlcode;`**

* In SQL*Plus, tells the script to **exit when an Oracle SQL error occurs**.
* Example: if a query fails with ORA-00942, the script stops.

---

**3. `set serveroutput on size unlimited`**

* Enables output from `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE` to be displayed in SQL*Plus/Toad.
* `size unlimited` → no limit on buffer size for output.

---

**4. `set verify on`**

* Controls whether SQL*Plus shows the **old and new values of substitution variables** when you run a query.
* Useful for debugging scripts with `&variable`.

---

**5. `set sqlblanklines on`**

* Allows blank lines within SQL statements in SQL*Plus.
* Without it, blank lines terminate the statement.

---

**6. `set timing on`**

* Displays the **time taken** for each SQL/PLSQL command after execution.

---

**7. `DEFINE dop = 8;` and `INSERT /*+ parallel(&dop) */`**

* `DEFINE` creates a SQL*Plus substitution variable.
* `dop` (degree of parallelism) = 8 here.
* In the hint, `parallel(&dop)` gets replaced with `parallel(8)` → runs insert in parallel with 8 threads.

---

**8. `DECLARE V_POS VARCHAR2(10) :=0;` and later `V_POS :=1;`, `V_POS :=2;`**

* Declares a PL/SQL variable `V_POS`.
* Assigned values (`0,1,2`) at different points in the block → often used as a **debug marker** (to know where an error occurred).

---

**9. `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(' no of rows ' || SQL%ROWCOUNT);`**

* `SQL%` refers to **implicit cursor attributes** in PL/SQL.
* `SQL%ROWCOUNT` = number of rows affected by the most recent DML (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).
* Other attributes: `SQL%FOUND`, `SQL%NOTFOUND`, `SQL%ISOPEN`.

---

**10. `prompt End of process:`**

* `PROMPT` is a SQL*Plus command to print text to screen.
* Unlike `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE`, it does **not require serveroutput on** and is **not PL/SQL**.
* Used for user messages in scripts.

---
If your .sql file sits on a Unix server and is scheduled via Control-M, here’s what happens:
- Control-M will call an Oracle client (command-line) to run the script.
- That client is almost always sqlplus (sometimes sqlcl, but rarely in legacy projects).
- SQL Developer is a GUI IDE, not designed to be run in batch/scheduled mode.
- Whatever sqlplus prints (results, DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE, PROMPT, row counts, ORA- errors, etc.) → goes to the job log generated by Control-M. You can view this in Control-M GUI (Job Output / Log tab).
