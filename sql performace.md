Interview Questions- Performance issues in SQL!!

Interviewer: "We've been experiencing slow query performance on our database, specifically with the following query:
```
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date > '2020-01-01'
```
Can you suggest some ways to improve its performance?"

Candidate: "Yes, of course. To optimize this query, I would first check the execution plan to see where the bottleneck is. This can be done using the EXPLAIN command:
```
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date > '2020-01-01'
```
This will show us which steps in the query are taking the most time. Let's say the plan shows that the JOIN with the customers table is taking the most time. To optimize this, I would consider adding an index on the customer_id column in the orders table, like this:
```
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders (customer_id)
```
This should speed up the JOIN operation by allowing the database to quickly locate the matching rows in the customers table.

Additionally, if the products table is very large, I might consider partitioning it by product category or date to reduce the amount of data being scanned. For example:
```
CREATE TABLE products_partitioned (
 product_id INT,
 product_name VARCHAR(255),
 product_category VARCHAR(255),
 product_date DATE
) PARTITION BY RANGE (product_date) (
 PARTITION p_2020 VALUES LESS THAN ('2021-01-01'),
 PARTITION p_2021 VALUES LESS THAN ('2022-01-01')
);
```
This would allow the database to only scan the relevant partition for the query, rather than the entire table.

Finally, I would also consider reordering the JOINs to reduce the number of rows being joined. For example, if the orders table is much smaller than the customers table, it might be more efficient to JOIN the orders table with the products table first, and then JOIN the result with the customers table."
